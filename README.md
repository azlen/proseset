# Proseset

Fast-paced lexical spotting game about fusing and refactoring words.

## Components
- Deck of word cards (words may include single-letter cards).
- Timer or tally sheet if you want to keep score.

## Goal
Be the first to spot a group of three or more cards that can be concatenated into one continuous string and then resegmented into a different list of valid words without changing letter order.

## Setup
1. Shuffle the deck.
2. Deal 12 cards face up in the shared play area.
3. If players are stuck, deal three more cards at a time until a new set appears.

## Playing the Game
- There are no turns; everyone scans the table simultaneously.
- When you see a valid set, call it out and point to the cards (e.g., "Abstract Orange Lice!").
- Lay the cards together, show the combined string, then show an alternate valid segmentation (letters must remain in the same order; no rearranging or skipping).
- Any word from a standard dictionary counts, including 1-letter words like "a" or "I".
- If the group agrees the set is valid, collect those cards as a point. Invalid calls return the cards and you sit out until the next set is found.
- Refill the tableau back to 12 cards after every claimed set if the deck has cards left.

## End of Game
- Play until the deck is exhausted or a time limit expires.
- The player with the most claimed sets wins.

## Example
Cards: `Abstract` `Orange` `Lice`
- Combined string: `abstractorangelice`
- Alternate segmentation: `abs tractor angel ice`

Optional twist: award bonus points for sets using four or more cards or for segmentations that create particularly long words.
